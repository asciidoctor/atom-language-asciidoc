[GitHub is sunsetting Atom on December 15, 2022](https://github.blog/2022-06-08-sunsetting-atom/).   
As a result, we recommend migrating to an alternative solution. The Asciidoctor community is now focusing on providing the best writing experience using the [IntelliJ platform](https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-intellij-plugin) or [Visual Studio Code](https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-vscode).

On December 15, 2022, this repository will be archived.

Adds syntax highlighting and snippets to AsciiDoc files. Supports [Asciidoctor](http://asciidoctor.org/)-specific features.

**NOTE:** This package recognizes the modern AsciiDoc syntax endorsed by Asciidoctor. It does not support the legacy AsciiDoc syntax permitted by Asciidoctor with [compat mode](http://asciidoctor.org/docs/migration/#compat-mode) enabled or by AsciiDoc Python. Additionally, two-line section titles are _not recognized_ by this package since they confuse both the language highlighter and the writer.

## File extension support

The default file extensions for AsciiDoc files are _ad_, _asc_, _adoc_, _asciidoc_, and _asciidoc.txt_
Changing the file extension to _asciidoc.txt_ is a recommended solution to remain compatibile with _.txt_ based tooling, whilst having a distinct filename related to the AsciiDoc language.
To add a different file extension, such at _.txt_, customize your Atom configuration:

Open the Atom configuration:
* Menu > _Edit_ > _Config.._
* 'Application: open your config' via the Command Palette
* Edit `~/.atom/config.cson`

Add a custom file type support:
```coffee
  core:
    ...
    customFileTypes:
      "source.asciidoc": [
          "foo" # all files with `.foo` extension (ex: `documentation.foo`)
          "foobar.txt" # all files with `.foobar.txt` extension  (ex `documentation.foobar.txt`)
      ]
    ...
```

Then save the configuration file and restart Atom or press <kbd>ctrl + alt + r</kbd> to refresh the UI.  You should now see the new file type recognized by the atom-language-asciidoc package.
